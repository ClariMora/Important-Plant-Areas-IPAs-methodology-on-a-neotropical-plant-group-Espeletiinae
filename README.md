# Conservation proposal for the Espeletiinae subtribe (Asteraceae) based on the Important Plant Areas (IPAs) methodology
Building on the previous work on identifying IPAs (Important Plant Areas) in tropical countries (Diazgranados & Castellanos, 2018), we aimed to apply the IPA methodology in a highly biodiverse region such as the tropical Andes. In this study, we built a high-quality and georeferenced dataset with occurrence data belonging to species of the Espeletiinae subtribe. We also discussed the methods and criteria for implementing the IPA methodology in the tropical Andes region and the challenges in managing occurrence data and associated metadata. This study represents the first regional-level application of the IPA concept and provides an example of applying a systematic conservation approach to Espeletiinae in the Andean region.
